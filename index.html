                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p class="bio">My name is Jordan Jones. I was born and raised in Baltimore, MD.</p>

                <p class="bio">I'm 26 years old and in a past life I was a professional basketball player. Due to unforeseen circumstances 
                    out of my control that involved me breaking my foot twice, I began to seek other opportunities to make a living.</p>

                <p class="bio">I always enjoyed working with young people and had the opportunity to become a teacher. Though I'm completely 
                    new to teaching, I'm enjoying not only my own growth but also the growth of the students I teach.</p>

                <p class="bio">Having lived in Germany and about an hour north of New York City, I was able to see how public transportation 
                    is a vital part of a city's growth and development. This sparked a strong conviction in me to help bring that 
                    same development all over the world.</p>

                <p class="bio">I am a firm believer in cities. I believe they should be living, breathing systems. Most importantly, 
                    I believe they should prioritize people over cars.</p>

                <p class="bio">This is my website - read some of my thoughts, ask me questions, and let's connect. I'm always down for coffee 
                    or virtual chats. We need community now more than ever, so let's keep building.</p>
