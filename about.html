                <p class="bio">From professional basketball courts to classrooms and city planning meetings, my journey has been anything but conventional. As a former professional basketball player, I learned the value of teamwork and perseverance. Now, as an educator, I bring those same principles to the classroom, inspiring the next generation. My passion for transit advocacy stems from a deep belief that accessible public transportation is the backbone of equitable, sustainable communities.</p>
